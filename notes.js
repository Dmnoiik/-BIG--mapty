4. Architecture (HOW we will build)
5. Development step (Implementation of our plan using code)

1. USER STORIES - Description of the application's functionality from the user's perspective.
Common format: As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]. Asnwers question who, what and why

Examples:

3) As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance, so I can easily track my progress over time

4) As a user, I want to also see my workouts on a map, so I can easily check where I work out the most
